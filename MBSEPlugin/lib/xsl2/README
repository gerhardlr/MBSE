Welcome to the DocBook XSLT 2.0 stylesheets.

These stylesheets represent a different line of development from the
XSLT 1.0 stylesheets maintained at

http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/

That said, they are clearly derived from that work, so tip o' the hat
to everyone who's helped over there. And a special nod to Jirka Kosek
who did a lot of work on the XSLT 2.0 FO stylesheets.

Although I've been using the 2.0 stylesheets almost exclusively for
more than a year, they have only very recently had any sort of public
release. There are probably bugs.

Releases are maintained at docbook.github.com.
