Release Notes
=============
RELEASE 17.0.5 2014-09-17 

Added rename functionality for system elements: if the modeler renames
	  the block then all the packages which were created with the
	  getTemplate facility will be renamed accordingly.

Initial implementation of a simple safety computation, based on a dedicated profile done
	  at ESO.
	  For the time being this is merely listing all the elements from a
	  Hazard to the BasicFaults leading to it.
	  Value tags like probability, MTBF and such may be added to the
	  output later, for using it with either spreadsheet calculations
	  or in other ways.
	  Work in progress.

Added initial support for GenericTables using metachains. 
Also added "micro" character to HTML conversion.

Measures related to MDUMLCS-13047:  DependencyMatrix Diagrams are recomputed prior to 
      exporting them, in order to avoid the meaningless empty diagrams which have bothered us for so long. 

MBDG-135: added useDocumentation also for tableDiagram handling.
	  
Better aproach to unicode storage in the source code: a better library for conversion 
      still needs to be identified though.

MBDG-130: port MBSE plugin to MD 17.0.5, removed some deprecated methods.
MBDG-135: You cannot put in a DocBook the documentation of a diagram, but only
	  of a block. Fixed.
	  Added initial implementation to processFigureDiagram() after corresponding modification 
	  of the DocBookProfile. The tag "useDocumentation" is a boolean, but it is only
	  considered if the useText is set to no.
	  
	  Notice that there is no way (or at least I could not find any) to
	  restrict the documentation to only the one show in the lower left
	  corner of MagicDraw.
	  That means, the content of *all* comments for which the specific
	  diagram is the annotated element will be shown.

Added MBSE option to clean-up the image files.
	  This is only done when PDF generation is requested, after it has
	  been done.

Added initial support for DependencyMatrix.
	  It had been errenously assumed that DiagramTable would generalize
	  DependencyMatrix, but in practice a DependencyMatrix stereotype
	  does not have the wealth of tags used for table formatting which
	  DiagramTable has.
	  For this purpose the method processDiagramTable() was modified to
	  check which stereotype is applied to the Diagram referred by the
	  <<tableDiagram>> element. If the diagram is not stereotyped by
	  <<DiagramTable>>, then an image will be generated (and not a
	  DocBook table as in the other case).

Added a check in case the user did not specify HTML elements in the Table
	  Paragraph.

Avoiding ElementsSelectionDialog to show also elements under Diagrams.
	  Replaced some deprecated methods.

convertHTML2DocBook: now intercepting non HTML code and replacing
	  < and > by the corresponding proper HTML tags.

Array out of bounds related to MBDG-128: fixed.
Modified launch properties according to MDUMLCS-11380

MBDG-128:  Facilitate modeling of "configuration item IDs" , only relevant
	  for ESO: improved the visualization of PresentationElement, which
	  now visualizes automatically the tagged values.
	  Initial implementation of comfort routine to add configuration
	  item number to some structural parts of a model.
	  This is a diagram context menu action which sets a stereotype and
	  pops up a panel to enter a number for the tagged value.
	  This is of interest to ESO only and a way shall be found to
	  prevent this function to pop-up outside the ESO LAN.



Release 17.0.4SP1 2013-09-03
* Ajdust release with MD release numbers
* JIRA MBDG-14: hyperlinking to diagram/table when creating figureDiagram/tableDiagram
* use ${magic_draw_home} sting substitution variable in debug launcher instead of hardcoded path
* fixed debug launcher: wrong project name and missing -verbose application argument
* ask user to overwrite files for PDF and direct-PDF generation. NOT for XML only
* .gitignore file added for git-svn users
* patch: column count for tableParagraph, wrong regexp was used before.
* patch: skip recreation of XML file when 'SE2:Generate XML to PDF' action selected
* protected against NPE in getChildCount() method.
* Method deleteGeneratedImages() added to clean up the image files which would otherwise clutter the test directory and annoy with SVN commits.
* Relocated and renamed more Actions.
* Some minor cleanup on CommonGenerator, but much more needs to be done.
* Renamed MBSEDocAction to a more meaningful name.
* Removed unused HtmlGenerator, XmlGenerator: they were not being used and contained anyway a large chunk of code in common with the "CommonGenerator". Should they be reintroduced in the future, I would opt for subclassing/enhancing CommonGenerator
* MBSEBrowserConfigurator: done some cleanup on java packages fully qualified names usage.
* relocated additional classes to the reasoner package. 
* Removed unused classlocator package.
* Removed unused Wrapper and SpringUtilities classes.
* .launch file modified to have memory increased when running Variants tests, which else will fail (from within Eclipse, and from my machine).
* .classpath modified to remove  jarfile coming from Cameo Simulation Toolkit (this should make it independent of which CST version is installed).
* removed metrics packages. 
* relocated several (but not all) actions to proper packages.
* CLEANUP command line argument may now be provided to determine whether the output files will be cleaned up or not.
* Notice that the existing *.png files stored in the test directory are unaffected by this.
* forcing PNG as diagram image format in order to minimize changes
* with existing XML file (it also looks nicer when watching PDF files from Oxygen).
* Also renamed _rep into _out for XML files obtained as output.
* org.eso.sdd.mbse.doc.algo.CommonGenerator
* Added a method to substitute char in file names.
* Made the export format of diagrams configureable and set the default to SVG. 
* org.eso.sdd.mbse.doc.options.MBSEOptionsGroup
* org.eso.sdd.mbse.doc.options.EnvironmentOptionsResources.properties
* Added the configuration for the diagram file format
* Fixed some bugs with the ID for the properties file
* Did some clean up (removed the example code)
* align plugin version with MD version it supports, i.e. 17.0.2; SP are plugin specific
